# Roll_Dice
First multi-platform App that I built in Flutter Framework with the help of Dart which basically just rolls the dice

A new Flutter project.
 
## Getting Started 

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

✅ Flutter Concepts Learned in Roll Dice Project
🧱 Widgets & UI Basics
1. StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget – when and why to use them
2. Widget Tree structure – parent-child relationships
3. Layout widgets – Center, Column, Row, Container, Scaffold
4. MaterialApp and home: as the root screen
5. Text, Image, and ElevatedButton usage

🎯 User Interaction
1. onPressed: with buttons
2. Linking button presses to functions
3. Using setState() to update UI dynamically in StatefulWidgets

🎲 Logic and State
1. Dart Random class for dice number generation
2. Using a Random object (randomizer) to manage random number creation more efficiently
3. Concept of a "seed" and internal state in random number generation


🧠 Dart Fundamentals
1. const vs final – when and why to use each
2. Constructors: const constructors and why they're performance-optimized
3. Positional vs named arguments
4. Default values and optional parameters
5. List<T> and understanding generics


🛠️ Tools & Debugging
1. Using print() statements for debugging
2. Understanding why prints don’t show if setState() isn't used
3. How to auto-format with keyboard shortcuts
4. Understanding file organization in VS Code


📱 Simulators & Devices
